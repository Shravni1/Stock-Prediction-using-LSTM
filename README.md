# Stock-Prediction-using-LSTM
This is my task 2 for Bharat intern under the internship program of 'Data science intern'
The project involved collecting historical stock price data for a particular stock, in that we take tesla stocks Inc.
Then data was then pre-processed to remove any outliers or noise.
A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model was then trained on the pre-processed data.
The LSTM model was able to learn the patterns in the stock price data and make predictions about future stock prices.
The predictions were evaluated using a variety of metrics, such as root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE).
The results showed that the LSTM model was able to make accurate predictions about future stock prices.
The project was completed as a task for a data science intern. The goal of the project was to learn how to use LSTM models to predict stock prices.
